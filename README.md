# Angular Project - AlisedaApp

Welcome to the AlisedaApp project, built with Angular CLI version 16.2.2.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed along with Angular version 16.2.2.

### Local Environment Setup
1. Create a local environment file named "environment.dev.ts" to configure your variables. You can use "environment.example.ts" as a guide.
2. Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
3. Explore additional scripts in the `package.json` file for more functionalities.

### Development Server
Run the following command to start a development server:
```
ng serve
```



Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your browser. The application will automatically reload upon changes to the source files.

### Code Generation
Use the Angular CLI to generate components, directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules:

```
ng generate component component-name
```

### Build
Run the following command to build the project:

```
ng build
```
The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.


### Running Unit Tests
* Execute unit tests using Karma:

```
ng test

```

```
ng e2e
```
Note: Make sure to add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities before using this command.

### Additional Information
* Styling
* In the styles.scss file, you can find color variables that are available for the entire project.

### Best Practices
